# Project 1 - *Movie Flicks*

Note this is only the project setup
**Movie Flicks** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **6.0** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [X] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [X] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [X] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [X] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
- [X] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
- [X] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Use NSNumberFormatter to format numbers
2. Code organization is key in large projects
